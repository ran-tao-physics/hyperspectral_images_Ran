# hyperspectral_images

## Goal
Build classification model for high-med-lowcopper concentration.

## Dataset
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technique that captures detailed spectral information for each pixel in an image. This dataset is a set of hyperspectral remote sensing images that are captured by Hyperion imager of EO-1 mission, NASA.
